Self-Correction and Knowledge Builder for Autonomous Software Platform
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This script provides a foundational structure for enabling self-correction and continuous knowledge acquisition within an
autonomous software platform. It outlines placeholders for mechanisms that allow the system to evaluate its performance,
identify improvement areas, and integrate new knowledge into its operational framework.

Features included:
- Self-correction framework.
- Continuous knowledge acquisition and integration.

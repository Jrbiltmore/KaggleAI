Continuous Learning and Adaptation for Autonomous Software Platform
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This script provides a framework for continuous learning and adaptation, enabling the autonomous software platform's
ML/DL models to improve over time through periodic retraining and performance evaluation.

Features included:
- Continuous data ingestion and preprocessing.
- Periodic model retraining.
- Model performance evaluation.
- Performance logging and monitoring.

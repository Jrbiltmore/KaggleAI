Directory Ingestion and Preprocessing
-------------------------------------
This script navigates through a specified directory, ingests its contents,
unzips any compressed files, and preprocesses the contents based on specified
rules or functions.

It demonstrates a generic approach that can be adapted for specific data types
and preprocessing tasks.

Resource and Interaction Allocator for Autonomous Software Platform
--------------------------------------------------------------------
This script demonstrates a basic structure for managing resources and interactions within an autonomous software platform.
It outlines placeholders for algorithms capable of intelligently allocating resources and managing interactions, showcasing
how these functionalities could be integrated with the system's strategic capabilities.

Features included:
- Resource allocation framework.
- Interaction management.
